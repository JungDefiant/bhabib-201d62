      <!-- Text for biography -->
      <p id="biography_text">My name is Cristian Habib, but everyone calls me Bade, including my family. I was born in Alamogordo, New Mexico in 1993. At age 5, I moved to Colorado. At 19, I joined the Navy. My job was system administration and later penetration testing. I moved to Seattle after getting out of the Navy in 2018. I then went to South Seattle College and Seattle Central College. I recently got my Associate's degree with a focus in Psychology. My current goals are to finish up to 401 at Code Fellows, get a job in the tech industry as a software developer, and finish a personal RPG project.</p>
